chapter 3
Program Control Statements
There are three categories of program control statements: selection statements, which include the if and the
switch; iteration statements, which include the for, while, and do-while loops; and jump statements,
which include break, continue, and return. 
To read a character from the keyboard, we will use System.in.read( ). System.in is the
complement to System.out. It is the input object attached to the keyboard. The read( ) method waits
until the user presses a key and then returns the result. The character is returned as an integer, so it
must be cast into a char to assign it to a char variable. By default, console input is line bufered.
Here, the term bufer refers to a small portion of memory that is used to hold the characters before
they are read by your program. In this case, the buffer holds a complete line of text. As a result, you
must press ENTER before any character that you type will be sent to your program. 
The fact that System.in is line buffered is a source of annoyance at times. When you press ENTER, a
carriage return, line feed sequence is entered into the input stream. Furthermore, these characters are
left pending in the input buffer until you read them. Thus, for some applications, you may need to
remove them (by reading them) before the next input operation. 

the if statement
if(condition) statement;
else statement;
where the targets of the if and else are single statements. The else clause is optional. The targets of
both the if and else can be blocks of statements. The general form of the if, using blocks of statements,
is
if(condition)
{
	statement sequence
}
else
{
	statement sequence
}
If the conditional expression is true, the target of the if will be executed; otherwise, if it exists, the
target of the else will be executed. At no time will both of them be executed. The conditional
expression controlling the if must produce a boolean result.
Nested ifs
A nested if is an if statement that is target of another if or else. The main thing to remember about nested ifs in Java is that an else statement
always refers to the nearest if statement that is within the same blosk as the else and not already associated with an else.

if(i == 10) {
	if(j < 20) a = b;
	if(k > 100) c = d;
	else a = c; // this else refers to if(k > 100)
}
else a = d // this else refers to if(i == 10)

THe if-else-if Ladder
A common programming construct that is based upon the nested if is the if-else-if ladder. It looks like this:

if(condition)
	statement;
else if(condition)
	statemen;
else if(condition)
	statement;
.
.
.
else
	statement;

The conditional expressions are evaluated from the top downward. As soon as a true condition is found, the statement associated with it is executed,
and the rest of the ladder is bypassed. If none of the conditions are true, the final else statement will be executed. The final else often acts as a default
condition; that is, if all other conditional tests fail, the else statement is performed. If there is no final else and all other conditions are false, no action
will take place.

The switch statement
The switch provides for a multiway branch. Thus, it enables a program to select among several alternatives. Although a series of nested if statements can perform multiway tests,
for many situation the switch is a more efficient approach. It works like this: the value of an expression is successively tested against a list of constants.
When a match is found, the statement sequence associated with that match is executed. The general form of the switch statement is

switch(expression){
	case constant1:
		statement sequence
		break;
	case constant2:
		statement sequence
		break;
	case constant3:
		statement sequence
		break;
	.
	.
	.
	default:
		statement sequence
}
For versions of Java prior to JDK 7, the expression controlling the switch must be of type byte, short, int, char, or an enumeration. Beginning with JDK 7, expression
can also be of type String. This means that modern versions of Java can use a string to control a switch. Frequently, the expression controlling a switch is simply a variable
rather than a larger expression.
Each value specified in the case statements must be a unique constant expression (such as a literal value). Duplicate case values are not allowed. The type of each value must be compatible with the type of expression.
The default statement sequence is executed if no case constant matches the expression. The default is optional; if it is not present, no action takes place if all matches fail.
When a match is found, the statements associated with that case are executed until the break is encountered or, in the case of default or the last case, until the end of the switch is reached.
Technically, the break statement is optional, although most applications of the switch will use it. When encounered within the statement sequence of a case, the break statement causes program flow to exit from the entire switch statement and resume at the next statement outside the switch. However, if a break statement does not end the statement sequence associated with a case, the all the statements at and following the matching case will be executed until a break (or the end of the switch) is encountered.
You can have empty cases, as shown in this example:

switch(i) {
	case 1:
	case 2:
	case 3: System.out.println("i is 1, 2 or 3");
	  break;
	case 4: System.out.println("i is 4");
          break;
}
In this fragment, if i has the value 1,2, or 3, the first println() statement executes. If it is 4. the second println() executes. The "stacking" of cases, as shown in this example, is common when several cases share common code.

Under what conditions should I use an if-else-if ladder rather than a switch when coding a multiway branch?

In general, use an if-else-if ladder when the conditions controlling the selection process do not rely upon a single value. For example, consider the following if-else-if sequence:

if(x < 10) // ...
else if(y != 0) // ...
else if(!done) // ...

This sequence cannot be recorded into a switch because all three conditions involve different variables - and differing types. What variable would control the switch? Also, you will 
need to use an if-else-if ladder when testing floating-point values or other objects that are not of types valid for use in a switch expression.

Nested switch statements
It is possible to have a switch as part of the statement sequence of an outer switch. This is called a nested switch. Even if the case constants of the inner and outer switch contain common values, no conflicts will arise. For example, the following code fragment is perfectly acceptable:

switch(ch1) {
  case 'A': sout("This A is part of outer switch.");
    switch(ch2) {
        case 'A': 
          sout("this A is part of inner switch."):
          break;
        case 'B': // . . .
    } // end of inner switch
    break;
  case 'B': // . . .

The for loop
The general form of the for loop for repeating a single statement is:

for(initialization; condition; iteration) statement;

For repeating a block, the general form is

for(initialization; condition; iteration)
{
statement sequence
}


The initialization is usually an assignment statement that sets the initial value of the loop control variable, which acts as the counter that controls the loop.
The condition is a Boolean expression that determines whether or not the loop will repeat.
The iteration expression defines the amount by which the loop control variable will change each time the loop repeated.
The for loop will continue to execute as long as the condition tests true. 
Once the condition becomes false, the loop will exit, and program execution will resume on the statement following the for.

The for loop can proceed in a positive or negative fashion, and it can change the loop control variable by any amount. 
For example, the following program prints the numbers 100 to -95, in decrements of 5:
for(x=100; x > -100; x -= 5){
            // Loop contorol variable is decremented by 5 each time 
            System.out.println(x);
        }

An important point about for loops is that the conditional expression is always tested at the top of the loop. 
This means that the code inside the loop may not be executed at all if the condition is false to begin with. Here is an example:

for(count=10; coun2 < 5; count++)
    x += count; // this statement will not execute 
This loop will never execute because its control variable, count, is greater than 5 when the loop is
first entered. This makes the conditional expression, count < 5, false from the outset; thus, not even
one iteration of the loop will occur.

Some Variations on the for Loop

Multiple loop control variables can be used.
public class Comma {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i, j;

        for(i=0, j=10; i < j; i++, j--){
//            Notice the two loop control variables
            System.out.println("i and j: " + i + " " + j);
        }
    }
}
i and j: 0 10
i and j: 1 9
i and j: 2 8
i and j: 3 7
i and j: 4 6
Here commas separate two initialization statements and the two iteration expressions.
When the loop begins, both i and j are initialized. Each time the loop repeats, i is incremented and j is decremented.
Multiple loop control variables are often convinient and can simplify certain algorithms.
You can have any number of initialization and iteration statements, but in practice, more than two or three make the for loop unwieldy.

The condition controlling the loop can be any valid Boolean expression. It does not need to involve the loop control variable. 
In the next example, the loop continues to execute until the user types the letter S at the keyboard:
public class ForTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws java.io.IOException{
        int i;

        System.out.println("Press S to stop");

        for(i=0; (char) System.in.read() != 'S'; i++)
            System.out.println("Pass #" + i);

    }
}


Press S to stop
t
Pass #0
Pass #1
y
Pass #2
Pass #3
t
Pass #4
Pass #5
b
Pass #6
Pass #7
S


Missing Pieces

Some interesting for loop variations are created by leaving pieces of the loop definition empty.
In Java, it is possible for any or all of the initialization, condition, or iteration portions of the for loop to be blank.
For example, consider the following program:
public class Empty {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i;

        for(i =0; i < 10; ){
//            The iteration expression is missing.
            System.out.println("Pass # " + i);
            i++; //increment loop control var
        }
    }
}
Here, the iteration expression of the for loop is empty.
Instead, the loop control variable i is incremented inside the body of the loop.
This means that each time the loop repeats, i is tested to see whether it equals 10, but no further action takes place.
Of course, since i is still incremented within the body of the loop, the loop runs normally.

In the next example, the initialization portion is also moved out of the for:
public class Empty2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i;
        
        i = 0; //move initialization out of loop
        
        for(; i<10; ){
            System.out.println("Pass # " + i);
            i++; //increment loop control var
        }
    }
}

In this version, i is initialized before the loop begins, rather than as part of the for.
Normally, you will want to initialize the loop control variable inside the for.
Placing the initialization outside of the loop is generally done only when the initial value is derived through a complex process that does not lend itself to containment inside the for loop.

The infinite loop
You can create an infinite loop (a loop that never terminates) using the for by leaving the conditional expression empty.

for(;;) //intentionally infinite loop
{
   //...
}
This loop will run forever. Although there are some programming tasks, such as operating system
command processors, that require an infinite loop, most “infinite loops” are really just loops with
special termination requirements.

Loops with no body
In Java, the body associated with a for loop (or any other loop) can be empty.
This is because a null statement is syntatically valid.
Body-less loops are often useful.
For example, the following program uses one to sum the numbers 1 through 5:

public class Empty3 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i;
        int sum = 0;

        //sum the numbers through 5
        for(i = 1; i <= 5; sum += i++);
//        No body in this loop

        System.out.println("Sum is " + sum);
    }
}

sum += i++
means "Add to sum the value of sum plus i, then increment i."
Thus, it is the same as this sequence of statements:
sum = sum + i;
i++;

Declaring Loop Control Variables Inside the for Loop
Often the variable that controls a for loop is needed only for the purposes of the loop and is not used elswhere.
When this is the case, it is possible to declare the variable inside the initialization portion of the for. 
For example, the following program computes both the summation and the factorial of the numbers 1 through 5. 
It declares its loop contorol variable i inside the for.

public class ForVar {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum = 0;
        int fact = 1;

//        compute the factorial of the numbers through 5
        for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++){
//            the variable i is declared inside the for statement
            sum += i;
            fact *= i;
        }
//        but, i is not known here

        System.out.println("Sum is " + sum);
        System.out.println("Factorial is " + fact);
    }
}

When you declare a variable inside a for loop, there is one important point to remember: the scope
of that variable ends when the for statement does. (That is, the scope of the variable is limited to the
for loop.) Outside the for loop, the variable will cease to exist. Thus, in the preceding example, i is
not accessible outside the for loop. If you need to use the loop control variable elsewhere in your
program, you will not be able to declare it inside the for loop.

The enhanced for loop
Relatively recently, a new form of the for loop, called the enhanced for, was added to Java.
The enhanced for provides a streamlined way to cycle through the contents of a collection of objects, such as an array.

The While Loop
Another of Java's loops is the while. The general form of the while loop is

while(condition) statement;

where statement may be a single statement or a block of statements, and condition defines the condition that controls the loop.
The condition may be any valid Boolean expression. The loop repeats while the condition is true. 
When the condition becomes false, program control passes to the line immediately following the loop.

Here is a simple example in which a while is used to print the alphabet:
public class WhileDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        char ch;

//        print the alphabet using a while loop
        ch = 'a';
        while(ch <= 'z') {
            System.out.println(ch);
            ch++;
        }

    }
}

Here, ch is initialized to the letter a. Each time through the loop, ch is output and then incremented.
This process continues until ch is greater than z.

As with the for loop, the while check the conditional expression at the top of the loop, which means that the loop code may not execute at all.
This eliminates the need for performing a separate test before the loop.
The following program illustrates this characteristic of the while loop.
It computes the integer powers of 2, from 0 to 9.
public class Power {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int e;
        int result;
        for(int i=0; i < 10; i++){
            result = 1;
            e = i;
            while(e > 0){
                result *= 2;
                e--;
            }

            System.out.println("2 to the " + i + " power is " + result);
        }
    }
}
Notice that the while loop executes only when e is greater than 0.
Thus, when e is zero, as it is in the first iteration of the for loop, the while loop is skipped.

Given the flexibility inherent in all of Java's loops, what criteria should I use when selecting a loop?
That is, how do I choose the right loop for a specific job?
Use a for loop when performing a known number of iterations.
Use do-while when you need a loop that will always perform at least one iteration.
The while is best used when the loop will repeat an unknown number of times.

The do-while Loop
Unlike the for and the while loops, in which the condition is tested at the top of the loop, the do-while loop checks its condition at the bottom of the loop.
This means that a do-while loop will always execute at least once.
The general form of the do-while loop is

do{
   statements;
}  while(condition);

The do-while loop executes as long as the conditional expression is true.

The following program loops until the user enters the letter q;
public class DWDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws java.io.IOException{

        char ch;
        do{
            System.out.println("Press a key followed by enter");
            ch = (char) System.in.read(); //get a char
        } while(ch != 'q');

    }
}
Press a key followed by enter
f
Press a key followed by enter
Press a key followed by enter
u
Press a key followed by enter
Press a key followed by enter
q


public class Guess4 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws java.io.IOException {

        char ch, ignore, answer = 'K';

        do {
            System.out.println("I'm thinking of a letter between A and Z");
            System.out.println("Can you guess it: ");

//            read a character
            ch = (char) System.in.read();

//            discard any other characters in the input buffer

            do {
                ignore = (char) System.in.read();
            } while(ignore != '\n');

            if(ch == answer) System.out.println("**Right**");
            else{
                System.out.print("..Sorry, you're ");
                if(ch < answer) System.out.println("too low");
                else System.out.println("too high");
                System.out.println("Try again!\n");
            }
        } while(answer != ch);

    }
}

----------------------------------------------------------------
//            discard any other characters in the input buffer

            do {
                ignore = (char) System.in.read();
            } while(ignore != '\n');

As explained earlier, console input is line bufferd - you have to press ENTER before characters are sent.
Pressing ENTER causes a carriage return and a line feed (newline) sequence to be generated.
These characters are left pending in the input buffer.
ALso, if you typed more than one key before pressing ENTER, they would still be in the input buffer.
This loop discards those characters by continuing to read input until the end of the line is reached.
If they were not discarded, then those characters would also be sent to the program as guesses, which is not what is wanted.


Use break to exit a Loop
It is possible to force an immediate exit from a loop, bypassing any remaining code in the body of the loop and the loop's conditional test, by using the break statement.
When a break statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is terminated and program control resumes at the next statement following the loop.
Here is a simple example

public class BreakDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num;

        num = 100;

//        loop while i-squared is less than num;
        for(int i=0; i < num; i++){
            if(i*i >= num) break; //terminate loop if i*i >= 100
            System.out.print(i + " ");
        }
        System.out.println("Loop complete.");
    }
}

Although the for loop is designed to run from 0 to num (which in this case is 100), the break statement causes it to terminate early, when i squared is greater than or equal to num.

The break statement can be used with any of Java's loops, including intemtionally infinite loops. 
For example, the following program simply reads input until the user types the letter q:
public class Break2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws java.io.IOException{
        char ch;

        for(;;){
            ch = (char) System.in.read();
            if (ch=='q') break;

        }
        System.out.println("YOu pressed q!");

    }

}

When used inside a set of nested loops, the break statement will break out only the innermost loop:
public class Break3 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        for(int i=0; i<3; i++){
            System.out.println("Outer loop count: " + i);
            System.out.print("  Inner loop count:");

            int t = 0;
            while(t < 100){
                if(t == 10) break; //terminate loop if t is 10
                System.out.print(t + " ");
                t++;
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
        System.out.println("loops complete.");
    }
}

Here are two other points to remember about break.
First, more than one break statement nay appear in a loop. However, be careful. Too many break statements have the tendency to destructure your code.
Second, the break that terminates a switch statement affects only that switch statement and not any enclosing loops.

USe break as form of goto
In addition to its uses with the switch statement and loops, the break statement can be employed by itself to provide a "civilized" form of the goto statement.
Java does not have a goto statement, because it provides an unstructured way to alter the flow of program execution.
Programs that make extensive use of the goto are usually hard to understand and hard to maintain.
There are, hoewever, a few places where goto is a useful and legitmate device.
For example, the goto can be helpful when exiting from a deeply nested set of loops.
To handle such situations, Java defines an expanded form of the break statement.
By using this form of break, you can, for example, break out of one or more blocks of code.
These blocks need not be part of a loop or a switch.
They can be any block. Further, you can specify precisely where execution will resume, because this form of break works with label.
As you will see, break gives you the benefits of a goto without its problems.
The general form of the labeled break statement is shown here:

break label;

Typically, label is the name of a label that identifies a block of code.
When this form of break executes, control is transferred out of the named block of code.
The labeled block of code must enclose the break statement, but it does not need to be the immediately enclosing block.
This means that you can use a labeled break statement to exit from a set of nested blocks.
But you cannot use break to transfer control to a block of code that does not enclose the break statement.

To name a block, put a label at the start of it.
The block being labeled can be a stand-alone block, or a statement that has a block as its target. A label is any valid Java identifier followed by a colon
Once you have labeled a block, you can then use this label as the target of a break statement. 
Doing so causes execution to resume at the end of the labeled block. 
For example, the following program shows three nested blocks:

public class Break4 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i;

        for(i=1; i<4; i++) {
            one:{
                two:{
                    three:{
                        System.out.println("\ni is " + i);
                        if(i==1) break one; //break the label
                        if(i==2) break two;
                        if(i==3) break three;

                        //this is never reached
                        System.out.println("won't print");
                    }
                    System.out.println("After block three");
                }
                System.out.println("After block two");
            }
            System.out.println("After block one.");
        }
        System.out.println("After for");
    }
}

When i is 1, the first if statement succeeds, causing a break to the end of the block of code defined by label one.
This causes "After block one" to print.
When i is 2m the second if succeeds, causing control to be transferred to the end of the block labeled by two.
This causes the messages "After block two" and "And after block one" to be printed, in that order.
When i is 3, the third if succeeds, and control is transferred to the end of the block labeled by three. Now, all three messages are displayed.

Here is another example. This time, break is being used to jump outside of a series of nested for
loops. When the break statement in the inner loop is executed, program control jumps to the end of
the block defined by the outer for loop, which is labeled by done. This causes the remainder of all
three loops to be bypassed.
public class Break5 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        done:
        for(int i=0; i<10; i++){
            for(int j=0; j<10; j++){
                for(int k=0; k<10; k++){
                    System.out.println(k + " ");
                    if(k==5) break done;
                }
                System.out.println("After k loop"); //won't execute
            }
            System.out.println("After j loop"); //won't execute
        }
        System.out.println("After i loop");
    }
}
Precisely where you put a label is very important—especially when working with loops. For
example, consider the following program:
public class Break6 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x=0, y=0;

//        here put label before for statement.

        stop1: for(x=0; x < 5; x++){
            for(y=0; y < 5; y++){
                if(y == 2) break stop1;
                System.out.println("x and y: " + x +" " + y);
            }
        }
        System.out.println();
//        x and y 0 0
//        x and y 0 1



//        now, put label immeadiately before {
        for(x=0; x < 5; x++)
            stop2: {
            for(y=0; y < 5; y++){
                if(y == 2) break stop2;
                System.out.println("x and y: " + x + " " + y);
            }
            }

//        x and y 0 0
//        x and y 0 1


//        x and y 1 0
//        x and y 1 1

//        ...
    }
}
In the program, both sets of nested loops are the same except for one point. In the first set, the label
precedes the outer for loop. In this case, when the break executes, it transfers control to the end of
the entire for block, skipping the rest of the outer loop’s iterations. In the second set, the label
precedes the outer for’s opening curly brace. Thus, when break stop2 executes, control is transferred
to the end of the outer for’s block, causing the next iteration to occur.

 Keep in mind that you cannot break to any label that is not defined for an enclosing block. For
example, the following program is invalid and will not compile:
public class BreakErr {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        one: for(int i=0; i<3; i++){
            System.out.println("Pass " + i + ": ");
        }
        
        for(int j=0; j<100; j++){
            if(j == 10) break one; //Wrong
            System.out.print(j + " ");
        }
    }
}

YOu say that goto is unstructured and that the break with a label offers a better alternative. But really, doesn't breaking to a label, which might be many lines of code
and levels of nesting removed from the break, also destructure code?

Yes. However, in those cases in which a jarring change in program flow is required, breaking to a label still retains some structure. A goto has none.

Use continue
It is possible to force an early iteration of a loop, bypassing the loop's normal control structure.
This accomplished by using continue.
The continue statement forces the next iteration of the loop to take place, skipping any code between itself and the conditional expression that controls the loop.
Thus, continue is essentially the complement of break.
For example, the following program uses continue to help print the even numbers between 0 and 100:

public class ContDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for(int i=0; i <= 100; i++){
            if (i%2 != 0) continue;  //iterate
            System.out.println(i); 
        }

    }
}
Only even numbers are printed, because an odd one will cause the loop to iterate early, bypassing the
call to println( ).

I n while and do-while loops, a continue statement will cause control to go directly to the
conditional expression and then continue the looping process. In the case of the for, the iteration
expression of the loop is evaluated, then the conditional expression is executed, and then the loop
continues.

As with the break statement, continue may specify a label to describe which enclosing loop to continue.
Here is an example program that uses continue with a label:
public class ContToLabel {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        outerloop:
        for (int i=1; i < 10; i++) {
            System.out.print("\nOuter loop pass " + i +
                            ", Inner loop: ");

            for(int j =1 ; j < 10; j++){
                if(j == 5) continue outerloop; //continue outerloop
                System.out.print(j);
            }
        }
    }
}
As the output shows, when the continue executes, control passes to the outer loop, skipping the
remainder of the inner loop.

Nested loops
One loop can be nested inside of another.
The following program uses a nested for loop to find the factors of the numbers from 2 to 100
public class FindFac {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for(int i=2; i<=100; i++){
            System.out.print("Factors of " + i + ": ");
            for(int j=2; j < i; j++){
                if (i%j == 0) System.out.print(j + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
In the program, the outer loop runs i from 2 through 100. The inner loop successively tests all
numbers from 2 up to i, printing those that evenly divide i. Extra challenge: The preceding program
can be made more efficient. Can you see how? (Hint: The number of iterations in the inner loop can
be reduced.)


Self test
2. Show the general form of the if-else-if ladder:
if(condition)
   statement;
else if (condition)
   statement;
else
   statement;

3. Given
   if(x < 10)
      if(y > 100) {
          if(!done) x = z;
          else y = z;
      }
   else sout("error");
to what if does the last else associate: if(x <10) - ans: if(y>100)
4. Show the for statement for a loop that counts from 1000 to 0 by -2
   for(int i = 1000; i >= 0; i-=2)
5. Is the following fragment valid?
   
   for (int i = 0; i < num; i++)
      sum += i;
   count = i;

not valid int i declared in the for loop. can't be seen outside it. it is a control variable of the for loop

6. Explain what break does. Be sure to explain both of its forms.
	1) breaks out of loop. if we want to pass control to the line of code immeadiately after the loop. terminates loop
	2) we can use break label to break out the block labeled by specific label. As form of go to, to specify where we want to resume the program

Ans: 
A break without a label causes termination of its immediately enclosing loop or switch statement. 
A break with a label causes control to transfer to the end of the labeled block.


7.  In the following fragment, after the break statement executes, what is displayed?

    for(i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        while (running) {
            if(x < y) break;
            // ...
        }
        sout("after while");
    }
    sout("after for")

after while; break statement terminates the while loop inside for loop

8. What does the following fragment print

   for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       sout.print(i + " ");
       if((i%2) == 0) continue;
       sout();
   }

0 1 
2 3 
4 5 
6 7 
8 9
11. infinite loop for(;;) has no condition to stop. never stops
Ans: An infinite loop is a loop that runs 
12. When using break with a label, must the label be on a block that contains break.
Yes, break must be enclosed by labeled block
